                        In Japanese market PSPs, an application called x-Radar 
                        Portable came preloaded starting with firmware version 6.35 
                        (January 2010). This is a port of a map software for PCs and
                        mobile phones called x-Radar, developed by PetaMap. x-Radar 
                        Portable gets the location of the PSP on a map and obtains 
                        information of places around the user. It determines the location 
                        through "PlaceEngine" technology, via wireless LAN spots.

                    <p>
                        The PSP is powered by an 1800 mAh battery (1200 mAh on the 
                        2000 and 3000 models) that provides between four and six hours 
                        of gameplay, between four and five hours of video playback, or 
                        between eight and eleven hours of audio playback. The battery 
                        takes approximately 1.5 hours to charge and lasts approximately 
                        500 charges. The PSP is equipped with a two-pin docking connector 
                        on the bottom of the console allowing users to connect the PSP to 
                        a television or a monitor using a component or composite cable. 
                        The PSP Slim features an AV output on the top of the console, 
                        allowing users to play games and watch videos on a television screen.

                        The PSP was released in Japan on December 12, 2004, in North 
                        America on March 24, 2005, and in the PAL region on September 1, 
                        2005. It primarily competed with the Nintendo DS, as part of the 
                        seventh generation of video game consoles. The PlayStation Portable 
                        was the most powerful portable console when launched. It was the 
                        first real competitor to Nintendo's handheld domination, where many 
                        challengers, such as SNK's Neo Geo Pocket and Nokia's N-Gage, failed.
